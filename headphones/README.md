Headphones 

Project Overview
This project is the implementation of a responsive landing page for a fictional headphones company. The goal of this project was to build a complete, functional web page from scratch using modern web development techniques. The design for this page was created by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer.

The project focuses on demonstrating proficiency in:

    HTML5: Semantic and accessible markup.
    CSS3: Styling, layout, and advanced features like Flexbox and CSS Grid.
    Responsive Design: Creating a single page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, specifically for desktop and mobile views (480px and below).
    Accessibility: Ensuring the page is usable by the widest possible audience.
    Project Structure: Organizing files, using CSS variables, and creating a scalable and maintainable codebase.
    Plain JavaScript: Implementing interactive features like a hamburger menu without the use of external libraries or frameworks.
